# LONDON BIKE SHARING

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on London's bike-sharing patterns. The project involves data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and visualization using Tableau to explore factors influencing bike rental demand.

Project Overview:- This project analyzes the London bike-sharing dataset to understand hourly bike rental counts in relation to various environmental and temporal factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather conditions, holidays, weekends, and seasons. The goal is to provide insights into bike usage patterns.

Files in this Repository:-
1. london-bike-sharing-dataset.zip/london_merged.csv: The raw, original dataset downloaded from Kaggle.
2. London Bike Rides.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook detailing the programmatic steps for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.
3. london_bikes_final.xlsx - Data.csv: The cleaned and transformed dataset, ready for visualization, exported from the Jupyter Notebook.
4. london bike rides - moving average and heatmap.twbx: A Tableau workbook containing interactive visualizations, including moving averages and heatmaps, to explore bike-sharing trends.

Libraries Used:- The data processing and analysis in this project primarily utilize Python libraries as demonstrated in the Jupyter Notebook:
1. pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
2. zipfile for extracting the dataset from its zipped format.
3. kaggle for programmatic download of the dataset.

Visualizations:- The london bike rides - moving average and heatmap.twbx Tableau workbook provides interactive visualizations to explore the processed data. These visualizations include:

1. Moving Averages: To observe trends and seasonality in bike rental counts over time.
2. Heatmaps: To identify patterns and correlations between bike rental demand and different variables such as time of day, day of the week, or weather conditions.
